 Task 1: Medical vs. Non-Medical Image Classifier 
Objective: Build a machine learning pipeline to automatically classify images as medical 
or non-medical from a mixed set of inputs. The goal is to evaluate your understanding of 
GenAI tools, classical ML techniques, and your ability to optimize for accuracy, speed, 
and scalability. 
Example: 
Non-medical Images:   Landscapes, architecture, nature, animals etc., 
Medical Images: Images of X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, or ultrasound 
Task Details 
● Input: Code should accept either a website URL or a PDF with medical and 
non-medical images as input. Note: Please consider any publicly available medical 
website or PDFs with medical images for testing 
● Output: For each image extracted from URL or PDF input, classify it as: 
○ “medical” or  
○ “non-medical” 
You are free to choose your own approach — classical ML, CNNs, pretrained models or 
GenAI-based techniques. Note: Preference will be given to open source models.

 Submission Format: 
● Public GitHub link with clean code and instructions 
○ A working script or notebook that takes a URL or PDF as input, extracts all 
the images and outputs predicted labels 
○ A short report or README that includes: 
■ Your approach and reasoning 
■ Accuracy results on a small validation/test set 
■ Performance/efficiency considerations 
● Submit 2 mins video (.mp4) showcasing high level process 
✏
 Evaluation Criteria: 
● Classification Accuracy 
● Inference Speed / Processing Time  
● Scalability / Model Efficiency (size, performance) 
● Clarity of Approach & Documentation
